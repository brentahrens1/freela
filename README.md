# FREE LA  
**DESCRIPTION -**
'FREE LA' is a full stack CRUD app built to help fellow Angelinos find free activities in their city. I broke it down into the four categories of music, nature, exercise, and art. 'FREE LA' is also responsive on all mobile devices.

**TECHNOLOGY USED -**

* React
* Firestore


**GETTING STARTED -** 
I began with extensive wireframing to map out routes, models, and a general look and layout for the site. Next I set up my firestore db and connected it to React to make sure I was able to send data from the front end and see it on the backend. 

**BIGGEST CHALLENGE -** Working with a new database. Especially Firestore which is fairly new without a ton of reference points online. 

**FUTURE PLANS -**
* Ability for users to comment on post
* search bar 
* rating system for each post 
* more categories (comedy, style)
* Make it so you can view others user profiles
* Eventbrite and twitter api
